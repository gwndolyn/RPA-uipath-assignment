Dear Chief Technological Officer,
I am the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the company 
that I chose not to invest in is Vestas Wind Company.
Vestas is a company that installs wind turbines across
the globe to create sustainable wind energy for the world.
The company has installed more wind power than anyone else.
However, from the data I've extracted, I have determined that 
the Debt-to-equity ratio trend has been increasing from 
2017 to 2021 while the Earning-per-Share ratio has been 
decreasing from 2017-2021. Hence, it is not advisable to
invest in this company as the earnings overtime would decrease.


I have attached the financial data graphs in the email
for your reference.
